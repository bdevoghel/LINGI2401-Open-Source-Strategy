## Project Selection
*End September*

For a first open source contribution, I wanted to select a project I would use myself. There are a few software I use at least monthly, but the one that caught my interest is a tool I really enjoy using. [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is the open source equivalent to Photoshop and is a great idea for this project.

Contributing to the real GIMP seemed to be a bit overwhelming though. Thus, I settled for a useful add-on, called GIMP-ML. GIMP-ML allows you to apply advanced Machine Learning and Computer Vision algorithms to your creations. As I've always been interested in these subjects, I decided to get to know the project.

### Getting in touch with the maintainer

As the GIMP-ML library only exists since March 2020, I wanted to be able to get the project to embrace open source. I contacted the project owner (only maintainer for the moment) to know if he would be interested in some help to open up the project to open source.
