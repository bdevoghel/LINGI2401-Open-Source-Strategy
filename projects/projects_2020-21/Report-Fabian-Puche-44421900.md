## Research and Selection of the Project

ServerSync is an utility for easy mod management that I used with friends not long ago when we wanted to play with each other on a server. We used it because we all had to install some mods to play on the server and this is not really straightforward for people who are not familiar with mods in general. 

The thing is that the tool was working fine but it had some troubles according to me. Especially the UI but also for exemple when you want to check if your list of mods is uptodate. You can't because the tool only download all the mobs and put them in your folder. It's not really pratice because the server could just update files that are outdated. 

To contribute to this project I joined it via [Loïc Laderrière](https://github.com/Hadyark) who is also at this course and already worked a bit on it. The project needs a lot of changes that was a bit too much for only one person. Then I decided to help. For this project we are working in collaboration but we are both working on differents things. Loïc already started to work on the UI and I will probably work on the updating of the mods when a user only want to update them instead of downloading all of thems. It will be very usefull if you're working with marge amont of mods
