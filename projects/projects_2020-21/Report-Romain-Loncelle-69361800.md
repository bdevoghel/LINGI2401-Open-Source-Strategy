## Project Selection

Given I was not a big user of open sources solution, I chose this course as an introduction to open sources project and how to get involved. I wanted to pick a project which wasn't too complex for my very first contribution and furthermore with a good community to avoid a bad experience as much as possible.
In line with those ideas and after struggling a bit on other projects, I finally found a project which could be part of my discovery process.

### Contributor Covenant

Contributor Covenant is basically a Code of Conduct for Open Source Projects and Communities.
The goal of this project is to make Open Source Projects available to every single person whoever you are.
Furthermore, it tries to make contributions to projects as accessible and welcoming as possible.
To do so, a Code of Conduct is written (and rewritten over the years) and made available to whoever wants to use it in his project. You can find several translations of this Code of Conduct.
Nevertheless, not all translations have the same version of the Code of Conduct (latest version 2.0), such as french which hasn't been updated for a while and is still in version 1.4.
The code of conduct has already been adopted by many Open Source Projects, some of them are already well known.

### Getting into it !

So basically, the first thing I did was to open issue. In this one, I explained that as a french native-speaker I could help on updating the french version of the Code of Conduct. And no more than later the same day, I was asked to do it !
Thus, I started working on the translation and as mentionned in the [README](https://github.com/ContributorCovenant/contributor_covenant#translating), I just had to fork the project and create my own branch. Then after ending my initial translation and after few minutes of hesitations, I did my pull request.
That's when I realized that my work could be read by a lot of people (maybe too much), that was very exciting, but even more stressful.
Once more, it only took few hours to get an answer to it and a couple of other native speakers were ask to review the translation. I worked with amazing people with great ideas, they helped me a lot, even more when I told them that was my very first contribution. They gave some advices and some explanations of the typical workflow for this kind of task.

### Conclusion

Since we are still working on the last changes we want to make to the text, the pull request hasn't been accepted yet. Nevertheless, so far, it has been a great experience and now I hope that our work would help people, which like me, aren't too confident about contributing to an open source project.
