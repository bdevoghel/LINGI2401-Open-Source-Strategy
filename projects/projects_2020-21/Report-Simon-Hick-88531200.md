## Project choice

I like the idea of being getting involved in an open-source project not only for this course, but also afterward in my daily life. So, after looking at some open-source projects that were in the line with my option and my thesis, I realised that no personnal interest was driving me to contribute to such projects. Then I stumbled upon a mod being developed for one of my favourite game. This mod wants to make the singleplayer campaign in Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord playable in multiplayer. The Mount and Blade license has been one of my favourite for years now, and having a multiplayer campaign is definitely something I wished had existed many time before. Given how enticing this looks to me, my choice is made.

### BannerlordCoop Community

The mod is mainly being developped by two people [araex](https://github.com/araex) and [garrettluskey](https://github.com/garrettluskey), but has a team comprised of two testers, a community manager and multiple developers. The community has a discord channel to discuss, help each other and even post memes. This is great for multiple reasons, since it is very easy to ask for help and to discuss with other members about issues and pull requests. 

### My Contribution

I chose the following issue: [Automatically pause the game when pending event queue grows too large #57](https://github.com/Bannerlord-Coop-Team/BannerlordCoop/issues/57), which has been already tried by another developer before, but he moved to another issue instead. I have already made my pull request, but I don't expect it to be accepted right away and so I'm currenlty waiting for the feedback of Araex.
