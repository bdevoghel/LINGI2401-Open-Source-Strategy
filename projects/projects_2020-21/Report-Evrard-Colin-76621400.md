## Introduction
In the context of this course, the assignment was to make a significant to an open source project. So I went on the hunt for the perfect project.
## The project hunt
There was a few candidates for my selection but my main criterions was for it to be software that I use or have used. In the end there were 3 projects that seemed interesting.
 1. [Newpipe](https://newpipe.schabi.org/) an open source youtube client for android.
 2. [Libgdx](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) A game library in java that I had used for a game or two.
 3. [Evobot](https://github.com/eritislami/evobot) A music bot for discord that can stream from various sources.

## Work intents
Even though it's a bit (very) late in the semester, I'm confident that I will be able to make a significant contribution to [Evobot](https://github.com/eritislami/evobot). My confidence originates from 2 factors.

1. That project is realised using technologies I've used before (Node, REST APIs).
2. The project is relatively young and quite active (some commits done last week).

All that being said, I have 2 goals for this project's contribution.
My first is to fix a [bug](https://github.com/eritislami/evobot/issues/328) which prevents URLs from soundcloud's mobile links to be used. 

The second is to add a commonly requested [feature](https://github.com/eritislami/evobot/issues/358): an ability to specify permissions on a per discord-role basis. 

## PS
I have no real excuse for being this late in the project's elaboration. I'll compensate by finishing it asap.
