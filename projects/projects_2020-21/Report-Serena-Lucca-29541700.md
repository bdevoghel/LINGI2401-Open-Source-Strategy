# Selection of the project

- At first, I wanted to contribute to one of python's big libraries. The problem here is that it is very hard to find an issue that is interesting and good for beginners. 
- I kept looking for a project in python but most of them seemed uninteresting to me.
- I searched for projects in other programming languages such as C and Java.
- I looked up the libraries in javascript and typescript that I was using for another project but as a mather of fact I did not have enough skills to contribute to one of those.
- After 10 weeks of research I decided to check out the Exercism repo because I heard that each year, some students of this course contributed to this project. And there it was, the perfect [issue](https://github.com/exercism/v3/issues/2880). 

# Contribution to the project

*06-12-20*
Here we are, I found a good issue so I posted a comment to ask if I could implement it. No reply from anybody. I got bored and impatient so I decided to start working on it. All I had to do was to create and implement a few files:
- .docs/hints.md
- .docs/introduction.md
- .meta/design.md
- .concepts/lists/links.json 

I could also improve some other files but they really just seemed fine to me so I didn't. 
I had some questions about the way I was implementing the files so I asked them under the issue. No reply from anybody so I decided to do it my way.
That night I still had no replies on the issue so I decided to do the [PR](https://github.com/exercism/v3/pull/2898). The first commit didn't pass because I forgot to apply prettier on my files. The second commit passed all the mandatory checks.

I still don't have any reply under the issu or the PR. I'm waiting for reviews and for some discussion because this journey feels pretty lonely so far.
