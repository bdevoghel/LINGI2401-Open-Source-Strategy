*Selected project :* [ServerSync](https://github.com/superzanti/ServerSync)

## ServerSync
ServerSync is intended to make it easier for beginners to connect to a modified Minecraft server by automating certain tasks. It will sync all files and make any necessary changes for the user to join the server.

It is currently developed by one person (Created by [superzanti](https://github.com/superzanti) and taken over by [rheimus](https://github.com/rheimus)) it has +30,000 downloads on its [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/serversync)

### Project Selection
It was obvious for me to choose this project because I use it personally.
I find that this one has a great potential but that the lack of functionalities and its too rudimentary interface fail it. Having already thought about working on it in my spare time, it's a pleasure to be able to do this as part of a course to try to make it more popular in the Minecraft community.
