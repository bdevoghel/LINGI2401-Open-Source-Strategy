## Motivation:
My main motivation in choosing an open source project to contribute to is based on a personal project that I am aiming to achieve sometime in the future, and that is having education free for everybody and accessible by everyone, because everybody has the recipe but not all of us have the ingredients. I believe that people should not pay to get educated, since not everyone has the capacities to do so, which limits the imagination and invention of the people that cannot afford school/university fees

### What Could have Been:
The main project that I wanted to contribute to [freeCodeCamp][fcc], which is a community that offers teaching coding for free, following a curriculum. I spent almost a month discussing with the owners of the project on discord, trying to figure out what how I can help and contribute which was the most difficult part since each time a new issue pops up it gets assigned to people that already contributed to them. 

### Process:
For freeCodeeCamp I had to use [Gitpod][gg], which gives a ready to go development environment instead of downloading it locally because it doesn't support Windows directly without WSL2. There exists a template which shows how the layout of the method/function (called challenge) should be, where each challenge will have its own ID created by their database. But then i stopped working since i wasnt assigned any of the issues, and i jumped to [30-seconds-of-code][scc].
To contribute to [30-seconds-of-code][scc], i had to download the whole project locally then i had to install the integration-tools globally on my machine, which allows me to customize the content of the repository. The contribution is in the form of snippets, where there exists a template to follow in order for the contribution to be accepted. After that, i had to run 'init-content-repo' where they ask what language am I going to use so that they prepare the snippet and then i had to run 'create-new-snippet <my-snippet-name>' to create the snippet file that i want.
 

### What I ended up doing:
So [30-seconds-of-code][scc]is a platform that allows people to contribute any function that they want and that they deemed it helpful. The main challenge here was the communication also, since there is no communication form or any platform where I can get in touch to ask them what functions are missing, also the initialisation of the project isn't well explained i had to search on my own. But after contributing twice different functions, both were rejected because one needed to be in another [repository][repo] that also belongs to them, the second time it was because the function [(PR)][ff] that I wrote could’ve been done through a built-in function (Both functions were responsible for multiply the elements of list with each other using python). So for my next contribution I had to go over most of the functions that are already on the website, and then check if they can be done directly through a built in function, to avoid another contribution rejection.
The third contribution was actually a function that would calculate if the given year is a leap year or not using mathematical notations.
### 12/7/2020
My third contributions got rejected [(PR)][rr], for having a similar function in calendar.leap, which didn't really appear for me for some reason, but i ll keep on checking and then creating these small functions until one of them gets accepted.


### What I learned:
Contributing to open source projects isn’t a task to be taken lightly, in fact it requires communication skills as much as development skills. And i had to dig deep to understand the projects that are already on github and how to contribute to them, and to to find a good project that is related to what i want, because i didnt want to contribute to any project without a meaning for me.
Also, contributing to big projects is a bit tidiuous since there exists many contributors where some already have experience which gives them an advantage to being assigned an issue.
Other than that, it also tought me that people are actually interested in helping others, to teach otehrs for free which only helps me in my future project, but hopefully it will be for all majors not only programming.
